This template is meant as a small demonstration of how we'll
build out templates & views.

base.html sets up a simple HTML template with Bulma installed.

We'll override the title & content blocks to build our initial index page.

{% block title %}
  Public Data Portal

  At this point don't worry too much about the HTML!

  We'll focus on two things for now, content that we want to group together on the page
  will go into a <div>, and we can use components & styles from Bulma where we'd like.

  Below we make a few sections, one for displaying a temporary greeting and a second
  box that will contain the number of datasets.
  {% endcomment %}

  <div id="dataset-header"> {# in HTML id is optional, naming the div for future reference #}
  <h1>{{ name }}</h1>
  <h2>{{ region }}</h2>
  <h2>{{ publisher }}</h2>
  </div>

  <div> {# a class is like an ID but can apply to multiple (similar) items #}
    {# these classes are defined by Bulma, and will style the content #}
    <h3 class="title">{{ dataset_id }}</h3>
    <span class="subtitle"> current dataset</span>
  </div>

{% endblock %}
