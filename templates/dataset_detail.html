This template is meant as a small demonstration of how we'll
build out templates & views.

base.html sets up a simple HTML template with Bulma installed.

We'll override the title & content blocks to build our initial index page.

{% block title %}
  Public Data Portal
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

  At this point don't worry too much about the HTML!

  We'll focus on two things for now, content that we want to group together on the page
  will go into a <div>, and we can use components & styles from Bulma where we'd like.

  Below we make a few sections, one for displaying a temporary greeting and a second
  box that will contain the number of datasets.

  <div class="title"> {# in HTML id is optional, naming the div for future reference #}
  <h1>{{ name }}</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
  <h2>{{ region }} | {{ publisher }}</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    {{ description }}
  </div>

{% endblock %}
